Some varieties of late peaches and plums continue into fall, followed by apples, persimmons, pomegranates, asian pears and assorted citrus and avocado throughout the winter. Stephanie and Roberto are here with us every week
and have been here with us at Portola Valley FM since the first year we opened.</p>
